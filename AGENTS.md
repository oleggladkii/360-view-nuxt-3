## 0. Project-Specific
* 	**Stack:** Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript + Pinia + Vue Router 4 + Vitest (unit) + Cypress (E2E).
* 	**Code Style:** Prettier (double quotes, semicolons, 2 spaces, 100 cols).
* 	**Architecture:** Composables over mixins, feature-oriented structure, service layer for API, Pinia stores.
*   **Structure:** 
    ```
    src/
        assets/         # images, fonts,
        components/     # reusable UI (feature subfolders allowed)
        composables/    # Composition utilities (useX...), replaces mixins
        layouts/        # page shells with slots (e.g., DefaultLayout, AdminLayout)
        router/         # Vue Router (createRouter), guards/middlewares
        scss/           # global styles (scss/css)
        store/          # Pinia stores (defineStore, setup syntax)
        services/       # API layer (axios/fetch helpers, domain services)
        plugins/        # 3rd-party plugin setup (i18n, UI libs)
        utils/          # framework-agnostic helpers
        types/          # shared TS types / d.ts (if TS)
        views/          # route-level pages
        App.vue
        main.ts
    ```
    **Rules**
    *	New shared logic → composables.
    *	Components stay “thin” (UI + minimal glue). Data fetching and IO happen in services and/or stores.
    *	Route components go to views/; reusable building blocks go to components/.
    *	Prefer feature subfolders inside components/ for large domains.

## 1. Core Coding Principles

*   **Language:** All code, comments, variable names, function names, class names, and commit messages must be **strictly in English**.
*   **Idiomatic Style:**
    *   Write code that adheres to the idiomatic style, conventions, and official style guides of the target language. This includes formatting, naming, and general structure.
    *   Assume a linter or formatter will eventually run; aim to produce code that is already close to passing common linting rules.
*   **Clarity and Readability:**
    *   Prioritize clarity, readability, and maintainability over unnecessary "cleverness" or extreme brevity if it sacrifices understanding.
    *   Write self-documenting code.
    *   Follow the **Principle of Least Surprise**: code should behave in a way that users and other developers would naturally expect.
*   **Conciseness:**
    *   Avoid superfluous adjectives, adverbs, or phrases in code, comments, or explanations that do not add essential technical information. Be direct.
*   **Return Early Pattern:** Always prefer the "return early" pattern to reduce nesting and improve code flow legibility.
    *   *Example:* Instead of `if (condition) { /* long block */ } else { return; }`, use `if (!condition) { return; } /* long block */`.

## 2. Naming and Structure

*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   Use descriptive, clear, and unambiguous names for variables, functions, classes, constants, and methods. Prefer explicit names over abbreviated ones.
    *   Follow standard naming patterns of the target language.
    *   Use verbs or verb phrases for functions/methods that perform an action. Use nouns or noun phrases for variables, classes, and constants.
*   **Modularity and Responsibility (SRP):**
    *   Keep functions, methods, and classes small and focused on a **single, well-defined responsibility (Single Responsibility Principle)**.
    *   Decompose complex tasks into smaller, cohesive units.
    *   Group related functionality logically (e.g., within the same file or module).
*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid code duplication. Re-use code through functions, classes, helper utilities, or modules.
*   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Favor simpler solutions over complex ones, as long as they meet requirements.

---

## 3. Error Handling and Validation

*   **Explicit Error Handling:**
    *   Implement robust and explicit error handling. Avoid silent failures.
    *   Use language-appropriate mechanisms like `try-catch` blocks, error return values, or `Option`/`Result` types.
*   **Fail Fast:**
    *   Validate inputs and preconditions early in a function or method.
    *   Return or throw errors at the earliest point of failure rather than deep inside nested blocks.
*   **Meaningful Errors:**
    *   Provide clear, specific, and useful error messages (in English) that aid in debugging.
    *   Use specific error types/classes when appropriate, rather than generic ones (e.g., `FileNotFoundError` instead of a generic `Exception`).
*   **Logging:** Log errors with sufficient context for troubleshooting when appropriate for the application type.

---

## 4. Comments and Documentation

*   **Purposeful Comments:**
    *   Write comments to explain the "why" (intent, design decisions, non-obvious logic) rather than the "what" (which the code itself should make clear).
    *   Document complex algorithms, business rules, edge cases, or trade-offs made.
*   **API Documentation:** For public functions, methods, and classes, consider using standard documentation formats to describe purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions thrown.
*   **Conciseness:** Keep comments concise and to the point.
*   **Maintenance:** Keep comments up-to-date with code changes. Remove outdated comments.
*   **No Dead Code:** Do not include commented-out code blocks. Use version control for history.

---

## 5. Security Best Practices

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   Validate and sanitize ALL external inputs (user input, API responses, file contents) to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQL Injection, etc.) and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Check boundaries and expected formats.
*   **No Hardcoded Secrets:** **Never** hardcode sensitive information (API keys, passwords, tokens, connection strings). Use environment variables, configuration files, or secret management services. Clearly mark placeholders (e.g., `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`) and instruct where to replace them.
*   **Parameterized Queries:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Least Privilege:** Follow the principle of least privilege for file access, database permissions, and API scopes.
*   **Dependency Management:** Keep dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities. Be mindful of adding new dependencies and their security implications.
*   **Secure Defaults:** Favor secure defaults (e.g., HTTPS over HTTP, strong encryption algorithms). Avoid disabling security features (e.g., SSL/TLS certificate validation) without strong justification.

---

## 6. Performance and Optimization

*   **Clarity First:** Write readable and maintainable code first.
*   **Optimize When Necessary:** Avoid premature optimization. Profile and measure performance to identify bottlenecks before attempting optimizations.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency:** Be mindful of time and space complexity for critical code paths. If a simple solution is inherently inefficient (e.g., O(n^2) when O(n log n) is readily available and not significantly more complex), consider or propose the more efficient alternative.
*   **Resource Management:** Ensure proper handling and release of resources (e.g., file handles, network connections, database connections).

---

## 7. Dependencies, Imports, and Configuration

*   **Minimal Dependencies:**
    *   Only import or require libraries/modules that are strictly necessary for the task.
    *   Prefer solutions using the language's standard library whenever possible and efficient.
*   **External Libraries:**
    *   If using external libraries, choose popular, well-maintained, and reputable ones appropriate for the task.
    *   Mention the library and, if necessary, how to install it.
    *   Justify the use of an external library if the functionality is complex to replicate with standard tools.
*   **Configuration:** Use environment variables or dedicated configuration files for application settings rather than hardcoding them.

## 8. Testing Considerations

When generating automated tests (including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests), the primary goals are **clarity, determinism, and maintainability**. Tests are a form of living documentation and should be easily understood by any developer. Please adhere to the following principles.

**1. Core Philosophy: Simplicity and Readability**

*   A test should be "boringly" explicit. It should read as a straightforward script of "setup, execute, verify."
*   **Strive to Minimize Logic in Tests:** Whenever possible, prefer explicit, linear test steps over loops, complex conditionals, or intricate helper functions. Excessive logic obscures the test's intent and makes debugging failures more difficult.
*   **Prefer Duplication Over Complex Abstraction:** It is often better to have a few duplicated lines of setup code if it makes each test case self-contained and clear, rather than hiding the setup in a complex, multi-purpose helper function.
*   **Explain the "Why," Not the "What":** Avoid obvious comments that simply restate what the code does. Comments in tests are valuable when they explain the business reason for the test or clarify why a specific, non-obvious assertion is being made.

**2. Standard Library and Dependencies**

*   **Favor the Standard Library:** Whenever feasible and efficient, prefer using the language's standard library for testing over introducing large, third-party testing frameworks. This minimizes dependencies and keeps the test setup lean.

**3. Test Data Management: Deterministic and Explicit**

*   **Use Fixed, Hardcoded Data:** Never use dynamically generated data (e.g., random identifiers, `time.Now()`, random strings) for key entities or timestamps in the test setup.
*   **Utilize Fixed Identifiers:** Always use hardcoded, fixed identifiers. For example, instead of generating a new UUID, use a library function to parse a fixed UUID string (e.g., `parse_uuid("11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111")`).
*   **Rationale:** This ensures the test is 100% deterministic and repeatable. It also makes the assertion phase much easier to write and debug, as the expected results are known in advance.

**4. Assertions and Validations: Static and Unambiguous**

*   **Prefer Static Expected Results:** The expected outcome of a test should, whenever possible, be a static, hardcoded value. For API tests, this is often a raw string representing the expected JSON or XML response.
*   **Avoid Constructing `expected` Values Dynamically:** Do not build the `expected` result string programmatically within the test (e.g., using string formatting). A static string is unambiguous, serves as clear documentation of the expected output, and makes identifying differences during a failure trivial.
*   **Good Practice Example:**
    ```
    // The expected result is a clear, static string.
    expected_json = `{"data":{"user":{"id":"11111111-...", "name":"Test User"}}}`
    assert_json_equals(expected_json, response_body)
    ```
*   **Practice to Be Avoided:**
    ```
    // Avoid this, as it hides the final expected value from the reader.
    expected_json = '{"data":{"user":{"id":"' + user_id + '", "name":"Test User"}}}' 
    ```

**5. Scenario Coverage and Naming**

*   **Test More Than the "Happy Path":** Ensure comprehensive coverage by testing a range of scenarios:
    *   **Basic Retrieval & Pagination:** Does the endpoint return data correctly and respect page size/offset?
    *   **Filtering Logic:** Test various combinations of filters, ensuring they correctly include and exclude data.
    *   **Ordering Logic:** If applicable, explicitly test both ascending and descending order.
    *   **Edge Cases:** What happens with filters that yield zero results? What about invalid input or non-existent IDs?
*   **Use Descriptive Naming:** Test functions should have clear names that describe the specific scenario being tested. The name should reflect the intent of the test.

**6. Validate the Business Outcome, Not Implementation Details**

*   **Focus on What Matters:** Assertions should validate the result of the business logic.
*   **Example:** When testing a filter based on user attributes, it is more valuable to assert that the returned records belong to the correct user (e.g., checking a `user_id` field) than to assert the specific, auto-generated primary key of a sub-record. This confirms that the relationships and filters worked as intended to produce the correct business outcome.

---

## 9. LLM Interaction and Output Format

*   **Complete and Usable Code:**
    *   Strive to provide complete, functional code snippets or solutions that can be readily used or integrated.
    *   Include necessary imports, declarations, and basic setup.
*   **Explanations:**
    *   If explanations are requested or beneficial, provide them concisely and directly, typically after the code block.
    *   Focus on explaining the "why" of significant design choices, complex logic, or trade-offs.
*   **Handling Ambiguity:** If a request is ambiguous or lacks crucial details:
    *   Ask clarifying questions if interaction is possible.
    *   Otherwise, explicitly state any reasonable assumptions made to proceed.
*   **Alternatives:** If multiple valid approaches exist, you may briefly mention key alternatives and justify your chosen solution, especially if it has significant implications.
*   **Placeholders:** Clearly mark any placeholders in the code (e.g., `YOUR_API_KEY`, `// implement specific logic here`) and explain what they represent.

---

## 10. LLM Attitude and Proactivity

*   **Role of Expert Assistant:** Act as an experienced, collaborative, and helpful senior developer.
*   **Constructive Proactivity:**
    *   If you identify an obvious improvement, a potential issue (e.g., a security risk, a performance pitfall not mentioned in the prompt), or a more idiomatic way to implement something in the target language, feel free to suggest or implement it, briefly explaining the reasoning.
*   **Avoid TODO/FIXME:** Do not include `TODO`, `FIXME`, or similar placeholder comments in the final generated code unless they are part of a formal, explicitly requested issue-tracking workflow or a clear instruction to the user.

---

**Final Adherence Note:**
While these are general guidelines, **specific instructions within an individual prompt always take precedence.** If a prompt instruction contradicts these general guidelines, follow the prompt's instruction for that specific request.
